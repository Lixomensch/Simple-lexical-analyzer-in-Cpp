# Simple Lexical Analyzer in C++

## Overview

This project implements a Simple Compiler in C++ for a fictional programming language. The analyzer reads source code, identifies tokens, and classifies them according to predefined rules.

## Features

- Identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, punctuation, integers, floats, and strings.
- Ignores whitespace and comments.
- Processes multi-character operators (`!=`, `<=`, `>=`).
- Reads input from a file.
- Outputs results of token analysis in text files.

## Installation

Ensure you have `g++` installed and run the following command:

```sh
make
```

## Usage

To run the analyzer, provide a source code file as an argument:

```sh
./lexer tests/test1.txt
```

Alternatively, you can execute all the tests in the `tests` folder and store the results in the `tests/output` directory by running:

```sh
python3 tests/run_tests.py
```

Or, you can use the `make` command to run the tests:

```sh
make run
```

## Cleanup

To remove compiled files, run:

```sh
make clear
```
